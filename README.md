# Customer Segmentation

## Introduction

This project aims to segment customers based on their attributes using K-Means Clustering. It utilizes Python and several libraries for data analysis, visualization, and clustering.

## Dependencies
* Pandas 
* NumPy 
* Matplotlib 
* Seaborn 
* scikit-learn 
## Data Overview
The dataset used contains information about customers, including their gender, age, annual income, and spending score.

## Data Preprocessing
* Imported the dataset from a CSV file.
* Checked for missing values and removed irrelevant columns.
* Renamed columns for better readability.

## Data Visualization
Visualized various aspects of the dataset:
* Correlation heatmap
* Gender distribution
* Age distribution
* Annual income distribution
* Relationships between attributes

## Analysis
Conducted statistical analysis on:

* Age distribution by gender
* Annual income analysis by gender
* Scatter plots and box plots for insights

## Clustering (K-Means)
Utilized K-Means Clustering to segment customers based on annual income and spending score:

* Determined optimal clusters using the elbow method
* Visualized clusters and centroids

## Conclusion
Summarized findings and insights from the analysis and clustering process.
